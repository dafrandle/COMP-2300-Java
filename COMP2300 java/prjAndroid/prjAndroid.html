         <p>I couldn't figure out how to get the data from the number boxes. (if you haven't watched the video yet you wont know what I mean by that)  
         I tried to use google to figure out what to do, but I was unsuccessful. However, it helped my find it myself. What I found is that I needed to use getText( ).toString( ) 
         to pull what I wanted out of the input. I figured that out by looking at the data stored in the input while debugging. Also, as a 
         consequence of the google I found Toast which was an easy method to display the answer.</p>
